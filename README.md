## Features

### Navigation Menu

- The Navigation Menu comprises four pages: Home, Courses, Our Instructors, and Enroll.
- It's designed to be responsive, appearing differently on mobile devices.
- Depending on the selected page, the corresponding menu item is highlighted.

- __Mobile__
  - A burger menu is displayed on screens with a width of 1200px or less.
  - When the burger icon is clicked, an overlay, a cancel icon, and a navigation menu appear, while the burger icon itself disappears.
  - Both the burger and cancel icons are positioned at the top right corner of the screen, maintaining their location even when the screen is scrolled.
  - When the cancel icon is clicked, the navigation menu is closed, causing the cancel icon to disappear, and in its place, the burger menu icon reappears.
  - The navigation menu is situated at the bottom of the screen.
  - The navigation menu is organized in a column layout.

- __Desktop__
  - If the screen width exceeds 1200px, the navigation menu is shown instead of the burger menu.
  - The navigation menu is aligned in a row layout and is consistently positioned at the top of the screen.
  - When a navigation item is hovered over, the text changes its color and increases in size.

### Navigation Headings

Each section with substantial content begins with an interactive heading. Clicking on this heading will cause the page to scroll to its corresponding content.
